# My Match Data

iOS app for recording and analyzing tennis match statistics in customizable categories

## Overview

My Match Data makes the process of scoring and analyzing a match far easier than it has ever been before. After entering in some basic information (player names, scoring type, etc.), you will be asked to choose which stats you would like to track. These "presets," as we call them, are what truly sets our app apart from the competition. Ranging from rally length to serve placement, a preset represents any individual statistic you might be interested in recording. Because anywhere from 0-3 presets can be used per match, you can always find the perfect balance between getting enough data and not spending too much time entering it all in.

## Description

My Match Data makes the process of scoring and analyzing a match far easier than it has ever been before. After entering in some basic information (player names, scoring type, etc.), you will be asked to choose which stats you would like to track. These "presets," as we call them, are what truly sets our app apart from the competition. Ranging from rally length to serve placement, a preset represents any individual statistic you might be interested in recording. Because anywhere from 0-3 presets can be used per match, you can always find the perfect balance between getting enough data and not spending too much time entering it all in.

In the Match Editor, the result of each preset is recorded with the simple press of a button. Then, to finalize the data, you simply select who won the point, which automatically processes all the information and moves the Editor on to the next point. Because of this, the results of each point can be stored in just 1-4 touches of the screen, which makes the entire process extremely straightforward.

With all of this useful information, My Match Data builds a custom stats page that updates seamlessly after each point. Depending on which presets you chose for the match, the app always finds the best possible way to represent the data on this page for anyone to easily understand.

In addition to presets and scoring, you are also able to enter in custom notes that are directly connected to the current point in the match. Quantitative statistics can't always get the message across fully, so this is perfect for keeping track of more complex information, such as changes in strategy or a player's body language.

Finally, because My Match Data automatically stores all of your matches locally to your device, the data you collect can be used long after the match is over. Specifically, in the My Matches section, you can view your old matches to determine trends in the performance of different players over time. In fact, with the search tool, you can even narrow down the list of matches to those played by a certain player or in a certain tournament, just to make your life that much simpler.
